# 404 Tracker 🚨  

**Revolutionizing the way we track broken links. Or not.**  

Welcome to the future of error management. 404 Tracker is a state-of-the-art platform that uses cutting-edge technologies like blockchain, quantum AI, and sheer audacity to identify and analyze broken links... but mostly just displays a spinner forever.

## 🌟 Features  

- **Infinite Loading Spinner**: Because good things take time. And by "good things," we mean nothing will ever load.  
- **Fake Progress Bars**: Engages users with random messages like *"Cross-referencing the multiverse."*  
- **Useless Reports**: PDF reports filled with lorem ipsum and quantum jargon.  
- **AI-Powered Link Fixer (Beta)**: Suggests groundbreaking fixes like "Turn it off and on again."  
- **Badge Rewards**: Earn titles like "DNS Destroyer" for no reason whatsoever.  
- **Leaderboard**: Compete to see whose broken links are the most broken.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  

- **Frontend**: A stunning blend of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to power our infinite spinner.  
- **Backend**: Python Flask (or Node.js) serving nonsense at the speed of dial-up internet.  
- **Deployment**: Hosted on the most unreliable free-tier platform for authenticity.

## 🌀 How It Works  

1. User submits a link.  
2. A highly advanced loading spinner begins its endless journey.  
3. Progress bars display scientifically inaccurate updates like *"Aligning DNS chakras."*  
4. A "report" is generated. The report contains lorem ipsum text and ends with *"Error 42: Cosmic interference detected."*  
5. User exits, their time forever wasted.
